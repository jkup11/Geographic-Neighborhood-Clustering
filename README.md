Geographic Neighborhood Clustering

This is the repository for Josh Kuppersmith's 2019 Senior Thesis in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. 
The broad goal of the thesis is to successfully cluster a grid representation of a city into data-driven neighborhoods.

Included in this repository are data processing scripts and notebooks, an exploratory data analysis notebooks, and modeling notebooks and functions. In addition, the thesis writeup PDF is available to provide context to all functionality. 

ABSTRACT: Open data initiatives in cities around the world have enabled new efforts to understand and improve urban areas through data analysis. In order to develop actionable insights to improve cities, it is important to isolate differences between geographic areas throughout the city. Neighborhoods are typically used as a unit for spatial separation, where each neighbor- hood is internally similar, and different from outside areas. As such, neighborhood analysis is key to developing an understanding of complex urban dynamics, yet current neighborhood boundaries do not always adequately reflect similar areas of cities. This thesis proposes a new clustering algorithm to automatically generate neighborhoods with highly similar inter- nal data profiles. Using a grid-model of the city, this new method of geographic clustering incorporates data accumulated within grid cells and build clumps of neighboring cells with similar data trends. This method is optimized using hyper-parameter tuning to improve an Earth Moverâ€™s Distance-based measure of within-neighborhood homogeneity. The optimiza- tion uses regularization to enforce smooth neighborhood boundaries, aiding us to find an optimal balance between data similarity and realistic neighborhoods. In order to build and test this algorithm, Chicago is used as case study due to its strong data availability, and illustrates the power of this model. By generating new Chicago neighborhood boundaries, and decreasing within-neighborhood crime homogeneity, we are able to see the relationship between crime and neighborhoods, and better detect sharp boundaries between areas of the city.
